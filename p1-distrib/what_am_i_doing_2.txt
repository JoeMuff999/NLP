word embedding: convert each word to a vector of some d dimensions
d is the # of input nodes we need for our network 

we actually just take the average of the word embeddings for our sentence
then this becomes the input for our NN

so like: "hello world" = [14, 12], then our input to the network = 13

actually, itcould be like the following. Say d = 3:

sentence = "hello world"

then,

"hello" = [1, 3, 5]
"world" = [8, 12, 0]

then: sentence = [4.5, 7.5, 2.5]
